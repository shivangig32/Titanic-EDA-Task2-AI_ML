 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 Internship Task 2 – Data Visualization and Pattern Recognition

 Objective:
To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to understand trends, patterns, and relationships within the Titanic dataset.

 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

 Key Steps:
- Summary statistics (mean, median, std)
- Univariate analysis (histograms, boxplots)
- Bivariate/multivariate (correlation matrix, pairplots)
- Pattern recognition
- Insights and visual inferences

 Key Insights:
- Females and children had higher survival rates
- 3rd Class males had the lowest survival
- Strong negative correlation between Pclass and Fare
